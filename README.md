This is an implementation of a large efficient flexible and trusty (LEFT) file sharing system. 
The aim of this project is to provide a method to design and implement large efficient and trusty file sharing using Python Socket network programming. The project should be able to share a file up to 1GB in any format in a high speed with no error. In addition, it should be able to resume from interruption, synchronize partially and provide data transmission security.


Notice: This program has appeared in the school's duplicate checking database. I have nothing to do with any problems caused by directly submitting this code as the answer to the assignment.
